## Motivation

The Distribution Calculator app was developed to teach some basic
statistic concepts used in biology. It includes some common distributions
used in biostatistics models and a probablity calculator using the normal
distribution as example.

## Content

In the Distribution section, it could be found some discrete and
continuous distributions. In each of them, you could play with the
parameters to see the changes in the shape of the curves. Also, it is
displayed some explanation/information about each distribution.

In the Probabilities section, it could be found the explanation about the
probability distribution calculation, and a example calculator with
the normal curve. It is important for the intuition of *p-value*, also explain the section.

### How to use Distribution section

You could change the parameters in a slider to see the changes in the 
distribution shape. In addition, some visualization options appears:

* Lines: in discrete distributions, you could show lines connecting the
points. This is very useful to see approximations to continuous
distributions.

* Mean/Variance: display these center/spread measurements in the plot.It
is hide by default to allow users to obtain them by hand and check the
result.

* Plot limit: in some distributions, to allow distributions 
approximations, the limit of the plot could be change to observe the
shape in a range of values.

* Function: in the continuous distributions, both Density and Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) could be displayed.

### How to use Probabilities section

In the normal example you could play with the parameters, and test some
upper/lower/both tail values. The shaded region indicates the probability and the numeric value appears below.
