## Probabilities

To calculate probabilities in continuous distribution, it is needed to
take the probability of more than one value, because an unique value
probability is near zero.

For this reason, in the app it is shown the probability of have a value
upper or lower than a value. The probability is the area under the curve
shown in the plot.

## *P-values*

The previous probability definition on a distribution is important in the context of *p-values*.

When you have a sample measurement and want to test the probability of this value being bigger or smaller (or both), this probability leads in the previous definition. This is the so-called *p-value*. Note that it is needed to know your meassurement distribution to calculate this probability.

In this app, you can obtain the *p-values* for a normal distribution and you could see visually the concept.
